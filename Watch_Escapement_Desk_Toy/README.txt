# Summary

This is a basic model of a swiss lever escapement, it could also be used as a desk toy.

I have always been fascinated by the inner workings of a mechanical watch, I have designed this model to understand the basics of how a watch regulates it's speed. The model's parts are very easy to print and uses common fasteners to hold everything together.

This video explains the basic working principles of a mechanical watch

# Post-Printing

When fixing the gear train, pallet fork, barrel ratchet and balance to the frame, make sure not to over tighten the locknuts. All the parts should move freely.


On the balance assembly, there are some slots where the adjustment of the impact pin position and pallet fork end stop could be fine tuned. Some minor adjustments with these components may be required for the escapement to work.

Make sure the barrel ratchet makes contact with the spring barrel tooth.
